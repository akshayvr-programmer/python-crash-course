# Python-crash-course
It is a crash course on python. There is everything you need to know to get started  programming with python.

# Pre Requisites
1. You'll need to install python. You can do that from going to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. You can also setup an IDE for the course. If you want to modify the code and combine a few things. Although I have given some empty blocks of code where you can try writing it by yourself.
3. You can install pycharm IDE from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
# Introduction:

Hi and welcome to my new Python Crash Course! In this course you will learn everything that you need to know to start programming in python. The Format of the entire course is in a google colaboratory notebook. 

The Video for all the topics covered will be released soon. 

In total there will be 3 notebooks. The first one is the basic Python Crash Course section where you have the introduction to the course, IDE installation, variables, data types, function, return statements, loops etc.
The second notebook will be on Computervision. You'll get to learn about a library known as OpenCv in python. You'll get to create haarcascade classifiers and use it in a program that you'll create.

The third notebook is a relatively longer and  a harder one. In this you'll learn concepts of data science and machine learning. 
The notebooks will be very informative all in themselves. You must check them out!

Don't forget to star, watch and fork! It will be of great help to me if you do that.

If you have any queries about the project kindly contact me on : akshayvr2@gmail.com


# Final Notes

In the first notebook, I've always left a few spaces for people to try  writing the code all by themselves. Try writing and modifying the code all by yourself. Please don't try to copy exactly what I've written. Understand the logic, think about it and Code!
The same pattern will be followed in the other notebooks too. There will be an intro to the concept - Some code written by me - A section where you can try writing the code all by yourself.


Thanks a lot to everyone who are reading this notebook. It's my pleasure for me to help people with programming. 


Happy Coding!
